# Python to optimize for chemical process design and optimization via derivative-free algorithms

A set of examples to optimize process simulators with Python and derivative-free algorithms such as GA or PSO.

This is a talk submited to the next Python Conference in Spain (PyConES 2016)

(work in progress...)
