# Chemical process design and optimization via derivative-free algorithms (written in Python!)

A set of examples to optimize process simulators with Python and derivative-free algorithms such as GA or PSO.

This is a talk submittedto the _great_ Python Conference in Spain (PyConES 2016)

(work in progress...)
